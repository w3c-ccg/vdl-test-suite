The purpose of this test suite is to demonstrate a path to interoperability
between the ISO-18013-5 Mobile Driver's License data model and the W3C
Verifiable Credentials ecosystem. The technologies explored in this test suite
are  experimental and meant to be complementary to ISO-18013-5 (mDL) and not a
replacement of the standard. This document contains the most recent
interoperability report, generated on a weekly basis, for Verifiable Driver's
License Credentials using the <a
href="https://github.com/digitalbazaar/vdl-vocab">Verifiable Driver's License
Vocabulary</a>.

  <p class="note">
The test matrices are generated by sending the payload in each example (without
the `proof` value) to an issuer. The digitally signed result of the issued credential is then
sent to a verifier. To generate the
interoperability matrix, all issuers are tested against all verifiers. At
present, all issuers and verifiers use the Ed25519 2028 cryptosuite.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
In order to demonstrate some of the compression features of CBOR-LD QR Codes,
the Ed25519 2020 cryptosuite is used. The QR Code contains a base-32
alphanumeric encoded CBOR-LD payload that is digitally signed using the Ed25519
2020 cryptosuite, which allows for better compression when used with CBOR-LD.
The digital  signatures displayed in this report, and the ones used with issuers
and verifiers are different at present. The digital signatures used with issuers
and verifiers will be updated to the digital signatures described in this report
when support for the newer 2020 Ed25519 cryptosuite is supported by all issuers
and verifiers. Readers should take note that the interoperability demonstrated
in the matrices are for the 2018 Ed25519 cryptosuite, and not the 2020 Ed25519
cryptosuite.

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The purpose of this document is to demonstrate that there are multiple Issuers and Verifiers
capable of processing Verifiable Driver's License Credentials that conform to the <a href="https://github.com/digitalbazaar/vdl-vocab">Verifiable Driver's License Vocabulary</a>.</p>

    <h3> Testing Methodology</h3>
    <p>The testing framework for the Verifiable Driver's License Vocab executes the following process:</p>
    <ol class="algorithm">
      <li>Takes Verifiable Driver's License Credentials produced from existing ISO standards</li>
      <li>Passes these Verifiable Driver's License Credentials to numerous Issuers</li>
      <li>Asserts that the issuer has issued a valid Verifiable Credential</li>
      <li>Passes the Verifiable Driver's License Credential to numerous Verifiers</li>
      <li>Collates the results in an interoperability matrix</li>
    </ol>
